==============

Unicode DB IME for Windows

This is an input method that allows you to type Unicode characters by searching for characters with keywords instead of having to remember the hexadecimal code for each character.

For instance, you can type in the keywords "u diaeresis" to find the "Ã¼" character, instead of having to remember 00FC.

As of version 0.99.3, the input method installs itself under the English (US) Keyboard.
