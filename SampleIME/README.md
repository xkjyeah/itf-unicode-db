Unicode DB IME for Windows.

This project will use the method used in ibus-unicode-db (available on GitHub), however it will run on Windows instead. =)

Currently faces two major problems:
1. I know nuts about Windows programming, let alone Text Services Framework.

2. Sample IME by Microsoft is very, very verbosely written and hard to follow. I cannot even get it to work reliably on my computer.

So, I begin this arduous journey with scanty documentation, and a terrible sample code. I'll be commiting changes to the code as I go along.
